The process was very slow because Google's Video Intelligence API was processing the complete video to generate artifacts and more than 1 artifact was returned by the API so, basically the results were not precise. This approach failed because Video Intelligence API was new and it was not trained properly. This approach might work in future when the API's will become more mature.",
